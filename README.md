# North Korean Missile Testing Data Analysis
Analysis of the DPRK's Historic Missile Testing Data

What do I want to do?
1. Group by Facilities and measure the numbers of test 
- OK
2. Measure the success and failure for the each facilities
- OK
3. Make a bar chart by timeline to assess the trend
(possibly layer with analysis as "Why DPRK launched so many missiles in these specific years?)
- Working progress
4. Map out the facilities
- OK
5. Find missile landing zones by frequencies and map it out if possible.
