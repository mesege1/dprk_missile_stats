# DPRK's Historic missile testing data analysis
The Korean War commenced on June 25, 1950, and concluded on July 27, 1953, with the signing of an armistice that established a divided nation. Following the conclusion of World War II, Korea, previously under Japanese occupation, was partitioned along the 38th parallel. 

Since then, North Korea has engaged in a series of atrocious missile testing activities, escalating tensions and posing significant security concerns to the international community. These tests have included the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), and short-range missiles, demonstrating their continuous efforts to enhance their missile capabilities. These provocative actions have raised alarms and prompted extensive analysis of North Korea's missile data to better understand the extent of their technological advancements and the potential threats they pose.

Therefore, analyzing North Korean missile data is vital for understanding the security threats posed by their missile program, verifying compliance with non-proliferation agreements, gathering intelligence, enhancing deterrence and defense capabilities, and maintaining regional stability.

# Data cleaning process
Changed ‘str’ values to ‘int’ or ‘float’
- Example: (km) values in the distance column
Replaced ‘Unknown’ values to ‘NaN’
Created new columns with given data
- Example: ‘Year’, ‘YYYYMM’ from dates column
