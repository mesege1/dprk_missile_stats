# North Korea's Historic Missile Testing Data Analysis Between 1984 and 2022

Course of Action Plan
What do I want to do?
1. Group bY Facilities and measure the numbers of test
2. Measure the success and failure for the each facilities
3. Make a bar chart by timeline to assess the trend
(possibly layer with analysis as "Why DPRK launched so many missiles in these specific years?)

4. Map out the facilities
5. Find missile landing zones by frequencies and map it out if possible.
