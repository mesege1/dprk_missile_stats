# North Korean Missile Testing Data Analysis
Analysis of the DPRK's Historic Missile Testing Data

What do I want to do?
1. Group bY Facilities and measure the numbers of test
2. Measure the success and failure for the each facilities
3. Make a bar chart by timeline to assess the trend
(possibly layer with analysis as "Why DPRK launched so many missiles in these specific years?)

4. Map out the facilities
5. Find missile landing zones by frequencies and map it out if possible.
